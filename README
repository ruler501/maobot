MaoBot

MaoBot is an IRC bot written to allow people to play the card game Mao.
As the bot and anyone who knows the game will tell you, the only rule of
Mao that you can be told is that you may not discuss the game. The bot
currently joins the #omnimaga-games channel on efnet and omnimaga.org.
Integration with the OmnomIRC client is expected later in development.
